So following on from the tradition of posting an "I'm In" when you are participating in [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/)<sup>1</sup>, here is mine for [Global Game Jam 2018](https://globalgamejam.org/).

After years of not doing much game development and never actually having somewhat of a reasonably completed game in my portfolio, I have decided to commit to doing Global Game Jam this year.

I will be participating at an event here in Perth, Australia and I'm going with the intention of meeting people and forming a group at the event. Since my expertise has always been programming, I hope to meet some artists/designers/other programmers and work as part of a team to get something done in the 48 hours.

Where I have usually let myself down in previous game jams is through too much scope and pursuit of perfection as opposed to just good enough. I really hope to meet some more experienced game jammers who can help me stay grounded and focused on getting one idea or mechanic complete in as short a time as possible and then polish from there.

As for the tools I will be using:

**Game Engine**: Unity3D (C#)

**Graphics**: GIMP, Aseprite

**Sound**: Audacity, SFXR

**Timelapse**:

```
while [ 1 ];do vardate=$(date +%d\-%m\-%Y\_%H.%M.%S); screencapture -t jpg -x ~/Desktop/Timelapse/$vardate.jpg; sleep 10; done
```

I also have one optional goal that I've set myself and that is to build a game that is playable on an arcade machine since I am currently in the process of building my own and I think it would be really awesome to be able to play a game I made on it.

Also been looking through the list of [diversifiers](https://globalgamejam.org/news/ggj18-diversifiers), there are a couple that have caught my eye:

- **So Sociable** - Build a game that uses a social network API
- **Upside down** - One or more game systems programmed by an artist, major art assets produced by programmers/coders
- **Look back** - Create a game which uses retro controllers of any type. No modern controllers! (which fits in with my personal goal)
- **Created by Warren Robinett** - Your game contains some kind of hidden secret or Easter egg.

This week I have started getting back into working with Unity3D so I don't go into it without any practice. I am very much looking forward to putting something together over the weekend, meeting some people and having fun.

<sup>1</sup> So the whole tradition of "I'm In" posts came about because there was a bug ~~feature~~ in the Ludum Dare website where a user didn't exist until they created a blog post, hence they got people to tell them that they plan on participating and what tools they intend to use.
