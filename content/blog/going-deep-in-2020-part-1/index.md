I don’t mind New Year's resolutions, I mean they make sense; it is a time for people to reflect on what they could be doing better and then they try and do it for a year, or about 3 weeks depending on who you ask. I think most people approach New Year's resolutions in a way that just sets themselves up for failure.

The approach that works for me is to set a single _“theme”_ for the year, something I am going to consciously focus on to influence multiple facets of my daily life. In the past, I’ve focused on _“expanding”_ which included broadening my horizons through travel, discovery and learning to find comfort in uncomfortable situations.

This year's theme for me is to **"go deeper"**.

It was inspired by a blog post I read on the [Raptitude Blog](https://www.raptitude.com/2017/12/go-deeper-not-wider/) and it is best summed up with the following quote from the post.

> _After you’re established in your career, and you have some neat stuff in your house, you take a whole year in which you don’t start anything new or acquire any new possessions you don’t need._
>
> _No new hobbies, equipment, games, or books are allowed during this year. Instead, you have to find the value in what you already own or what you’ve already started._
Throughout the last couple of weeks, this has started to resonate with me; I’ve made a habit of enjoying a majority of things on a surface level before moving onto the next thing.

Call it the _“bleeding edge”_ or the _“cult of the new”_, I’m always trying to stay ahead of the curve at the cost of truly and deeply appreciating what I have and what I know.

The timing couldn’t be any better. I’ve found myself the best job ever and can’t wait to see where that takes me this year, I have a super supportive partner who backs me through anything and I generally have a great life.

Already, I can see how I can **go deeper** in several aspects of my life including my hobbies, my approach to work and expanding my skills which I’ll dig into in a later post.
